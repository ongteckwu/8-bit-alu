Loading device for application Rf_Device from file '6slx9.nph' in environment C:\Xilinx\14.7\ISE_DS\ISE\.
   "mojo_top_0" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc6slx9, package tqg144, speed -2

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: 0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to 1.260 Volts)

INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be
   reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock.
   Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high".

Device speed data version:  "PRODUCTION 1.23 2013-10-13".



Device Utilization Summary:

Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     0 out of  11,440    0%
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         82 out of   5,720    1%
    Number used as logic:                       82 out of   5,720    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              72
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                   10
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%

  Number of occupied Slices:                    29 out of   1,430    2%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of   2,860    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           82
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            82 out of      82  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      82    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of      82    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  11,440    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
